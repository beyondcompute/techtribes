# Community Data Management

## YAML Structure

The [data/communities.yml](mdc:data/communities.yml) file contains all community listings with this structure:

```yaml
- name: Community Name
  location: City, Country
  tags:
    - Tag1
    - Tag2
  events: https://platform.com/community-url
  site: https://community-website.com (optional)
  logo: filename.png
  json: https://api-endpoint.com (optional)
```

## Required Fields

- `name`: Community display name
- `location`: Must be "City, Country" format (e.g., "Helsinki, Finland")
- `tags`: Array of technology/topic tags
- `events`: URL to community's event page
- `logo`: Logo filename (stored in [site/assets/logos/](mdc:site/assets/logos/))

## Optional Fields

- `site`: Community's homepage URL
- `json`: API endpoint for custom data scraping

## Data Validation

- Communities must have events in the past year to be considered active
- Location format must be "City, Country" for proper parsing
- Tags should reuse existing ones when possible for consistency
- Logo files must exist in the logos directory

## Sorting

- Communities are automatically sorted alphabetically by name
- Run `npm run sort` before committing changes
- Maintain alphabetical order when adding new communities
